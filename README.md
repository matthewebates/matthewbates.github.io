## Welcome to Matthew Bates's GitHub Page

This readme accompanies my repositories to link to small projects related to data science and python. Over time, I will add new repositories as they are developed. The main project shared from my portfolio implements a first-pass financial data analysis comparing google search frequency to stock returns. Other on-off projects demonstrate smaller components of stock analysis, as shown below:
* See here for a repository containing a larger analysis of [internet search frequency and stock returns](https://github.com/matthewebates/financial_data_analysis).
* See here for a repository containing several smaller [one-off stock analyses](https://github.com/matthewebates/one-off_small_stock_analyses).
