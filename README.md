## Welcome to Matthew Bates's GitHub Page

This readme accompanies my repositories to link to small projects related to data science and python. Over time, I will add new repositories as they are developed. The main project shared from my portfolio implements a first-pass financial data analysis comparing google search frequency to stock returns. Other on-off projects demonstrate smaller components of stock analysis, as shown below:
* See here for a repository containing a larger analysis of [internet search frequency and stock returns](https://github.com/matthewebates/financial_data_analysis).
* See here for a repository containing several smaller [one-off stock analyses](https://github.com/matthewebates/one-off_small_stock_analyses).

I am a researcher engineer specializing in decision analysis, risk management, and data science for the Engineer Research and Development Center, US Army Corps of Engineers. Principle investigator and project/product manager responsible for leading research projects and analyses for reimbursable clients in the Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies. I apply decision-analytic methods to complex, multi-objective problems involving policy alternatives, infrastructure, water resources, natural systems, and risk management, often under uncertainty. Frequently collaborate with partner agencies, research institutions, and academia.  Background in computer science, civil engineering, and risk and decision science.

Skills:
• Decision analysis, risk analysis, portfolio analysis, R&D prioritization.
• Monte Carlo simulation, optimization, value of information analysis, mathematical modeling.
• Decision making under uncertainty, statistics & probability theory, scenario & sensitivity analysis.
• Data analysis, analysis design, ability to summarize key insights from complex information.
• Software development and software project management. Programming in Python (w/ numpy, scipy, pandas, etc), SQL, VB.Net, VBA, C++, C#, Java, others. Agile development, Git, Visual Studio, Team Foundation Server, other SVN tools.
